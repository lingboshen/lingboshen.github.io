  title={Team versus individual: Evidence from financial analysts during COVID-19 pandemic},
  author={Lingbo Shen},
  abstract={Whether the performance of teams is better than that of individuals is still an open question. In this paper I look at one important team in the financial market, the financial analyst team, and take the advantage of the exogenous shock introduced by stay-at-home orders in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, to investigate whether analyst teams can issue more timely forecasts compared to individual analysts. The main findings are: (i) after the stay-at-home orders, both team and individual analysts issue fewer timely forecasts; (ii) compared to individual analysts, team analysts can issue more timely forecasts after the stay-at-home orders; and (iii) teams with female leaders and higher diversity perform better. In summary, this paper provides new evidence on the performance difference between teams and individuals especially during tough times.},
