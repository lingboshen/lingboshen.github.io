The model is a short-rate model. In general, the dynamics of the model is shown in \eqref{eq:hull-white}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hull-white}
dr(t)=\left[\theta(t)-\alpha(t)r(t)\right] dt+\sigma(t)dW(t)
\end{equation}

There is a degree of ambiguity among practitioners about exactly which parameters in the model are time-dependent or what name to apply to the model in each case. The most commonly accepted naming convention is the following:

- $$\theta$$ has $$t$$ (time) dependence — the Hull–White model.
- $$\theta$$ and $$\alpha$$ are both time-dependent — the extended Vasicek model.
