# Some Common Distribution

## The Normal Distrbution



$$\begin{eqnarray}
Z&\sim&N(0,1)\\
X=\mu+\sigma Z&\sim&N(\mu, \sigma)\\
f(x)&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}
\end{eqnarray}$$



Any linear combination of independent normally distributed random
variables is normally distributed.

Consider Multivariable Normal Distribution 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
X&\sim&N(\mu, \Omega)
\end{eqnarray}$$



If $a$ is an $m-$vector of fixed coefficients, then
$a^{T}X$, which is a linear combination of normal
distribution, follows 


$$\begin{eqnarray}
a^{T}X&\sim&N(a^{T}\mu, a^{T}\Omegaa)
\end{eqnarray}$$



If $X$ is any multivariate normal vector with zero covariances, the
components of $X$ are mutually independent.

This is a very special property of the multivariate normal distribution.
Usually zero covariance doesn't mean independent.

## The Chi-Squared Distrbution

Suppose the random vector $Z$ is such that its components
$z_{1}, z_{2},\cdots, z_{m}$ are mutually independent standard normal
distribution random variables, i.e. $Z\sim N(0, I)$. Then
the random variable $y$ 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqd1}
y&\equiv&||Z||^{2}=Z^{T}Z=\sum_{i=1}^{m}z_{i}^{2}
\end{eqnarray}$$



follows the **chi-squared distirbution** with $m$ **degrees of
freedom**. We write is as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
y&\sim&\chi^{2}(m)
\end{eqnarray}$$



The mean of chi-squared distribution is $m$, and its variance is $2m$.

If $y_{1}\sim \chi^{2}(m_{1})$, $y_{2}\sim \chi^{2}(m_{2})$, and $y_{1}$
and $y_{2}$ are independent, then 


$$\begin{eqnarray}
y&=&y_{1}+y_{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{m_{1}+m_{2}}z_{i}^{2}\sim \chi^{2}(m_{1}+m_{2})
\end{eqnarray}$$



::: proposition
1.  If the $m-$vector $X$ is distributed as
    $N(0,\Omega)$, then the quadratic form 


$$\begin{eqnarray}
    	\label{eqd2}
    	X^{T}\Omega^{-1}X&\sim&\chi^{2}(m)
    \end{eqnarray}$$



2.  If $P$ is a projection matrix with rank $r$ and $Z$ is an
    $n-$vector that is distributed as $N(0,I)$, then the
    quadratic form 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    	\label{eqd3}
    	Z^{T}PZ&\sim&\chi^{2}(r)
    \end{eqnarray}$$


:::

::: proof
*Proof.*

1.  Let $Z=A^{-1}X$, where $AA^{T}=\Omega$

    Since the vector $X$ is multivariate normal with mean vector
    $0$, so is the vector $A^{-1}X$. The covariance of
    $A^{-1}X$ is 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    E\left(A^{-1}XX^{T}(A^{T})^{-1}\right)&=&A^{-1}E\left(XX^{T}\right)(A^{T})^{-1}\\
    &=&A^{-1}\Omega(A^{T})^{-1}=A^{-1}AA^{T}(A^{T})^{-1}\\
    &=&I_{m}
    \end{eqnarray}$$

 So $Z=A^{-1}X\sim N(0, I)$
    Considering the quadratic form $X^{T}\Omega^{-1}X$,
    we have 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    X^{T}\Omega^{-1}X&=&X^{T}(AA^{T})^{-1}X\\
    &=&X^{T}(A^{T})^{-1}A^{-1}X\\
    &=&Z^{T}Z\sim \chi^{2}(m)
    \end{eqnarray}$$



2.  Suppose $P$ projects on to the span of the columns of an
    $n\times r$ matrix $Z$. This allows us to write
    

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    Z^{T}PZ&=&Z^{T}\bm{Z(Z^{T}Z)^{-1}Z^{T}}Z
    \end{eqnarray}$$

 Let $X=Z^{T}Z$, and
    $X\sim N(0,Z^{T}Z)$. Therefore,
    

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    Z^{T}PZ&=&X^{T}(Z^{T}Z)^{-1}X
    \end{eqnarray}$$

 where $Z^{T}Z$ is the variance of
    $X$. Use the first part of the theorem, we prove that
    $Z^{T}PZ$ is distributed as $\chi^{2}(r)$.

## The Student's t Distribution

If $z\sim N(0,1)$ and $y\sim \chi^{2}(m)$, and $z$ and $y$ are
independent, then the random variable 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqd4}
z&\equiv&\frac{z}{(y/m)^{1/2}}
\end{eqnarray}$$


 is said to follow the **Student's t disribution** with
$m$ degrees of freedom. We write is as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
t&\sim&t(m)
\end{eqnarray}$$



## The F Distribution

If $y_{1}\sim \chi^{2}(m_{1})$ and $y_{2}\sim \chi^{2}(m_{2})$, and
$y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are independent, then the random variable


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqd5}
F&\equiv&\frac{y_{1}/m_{1}}{y_{2}/m_{2}}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 is said to follow the **F distribution** with $m_{1}$
and $m_{2}$ degrees of freedom. We write it as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
F&\sim&F(m_{1}, m_{2})
\end{eqnarray}$$



# Tests of a Single Restriction

We want to test $\beta_{2}=0$ 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq6}
y&=&X_{1}\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+u\\
\nonumber
M_{1}y&=&\beta_{2}M_{1}x_{2}+M_{1}u
\end{eqnarray}$$



We find that 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\beta}_{2}&=&\frac{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y}{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}}\\
Var(\hat{\beta}_{2})&=&\sigma^{2}\left(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{-1}
\end{eqnarray}$$



For the null hypothesis that $\beta_{2}=0$, this yields a test statistic


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq7}
z_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y}{\sigma\left(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}\\
\label{eq8}
&=&\frac{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}u}{\sigma\left(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}\sim N(0,1)
\end{eqnarray}$$



However, we do not know $\sigma$. We need to replace $\sigma$ by $s$


$$\begin{eqnarray}
s^{2}&=&\frac{u^{T}u}{n-k}=\frac{(\bm{M_{X}y})^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{n-k}\\
&=&\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{n-k}
\end{eqnarray}$$



and we obtain the test statistic 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
t_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y}{s\left(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y}{\frac{s}{\sigma}\sigma\left(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{z_{\beta_{2}}}{s/\sigma}\\
\label{eq9}
&=&\frac{z_{\beta_{2}}}{\sqrt{\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{\sigma^{2}}/n-k}}
\end{eqnarray}$$



Then we need to show that
$\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{\sigma^{2}}\sim \chi^{2}(n-k)$. If so,
(\ref{eq9}) is $t$
distribution with degree of freedom $(n-k)$. 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq10}
\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{\sigma^{2}}&=&\frac{u^{T}\bm{M_{X}u}}{\sigma^{2}}=\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}\bm{M_{X}\varepsilon}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where
$\bm{\varepsilon}\equivu/\sigma\sim N(0, \bm{1})$. The second
part of Theorem 1 tells us that rightmost expression in the
(\ref{eq10}) is
distributed as $\chi^{2}(n-k)$

# Tests of Several Restrictions

Suppose that there are $r$ restrictions, with $r\leq k$.


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq11}
H_{0}&:& y=X_{1}\beta_{1}+u\\
\label{eq12}
H_{1}&:& y=X_{1}\beta_{1}+X_{2}\beta_{2}+u
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $X_{1}$ is an $n\times k_{1}$ matrix,
$X_{2}$ is an $n\times k_{2}$ matrix, $\beta_{1}$ is a
$k_{1}$-vector, $\beta_{2}$ is a $k_{2}$-vector, $k=k_{1}+k_{2}$,
and the number of restrictions $r=k_{2}$.

The test statistic is 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq13}
F_{\beta_{2}}&\equiv&\frac{(RSSR-USSR)/r}{USSR/(n-k)}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 Under the null hypothesis, this test statistic follow
the $F$ distribution with $r$ and $n-k$ degrees of freedom.

It is easy to find that 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
RSSR&=&(M_{1}y)^{T}M_{1}y=y^{T}M_{1}y\\
USSR&=&(M_{X}y)^{T}M_{X}y=y^{T}M_{X}y
\end{eqnarray}$$



By FWL theorem, the $USSR$ is the SSR from the FWL regression


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq14}
M_{1}y&=&M_{1}X_{2}\beta_{2}+M_{1}u
\end{eqnarray}$$



and the $USSR$ becomes 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
USSR&=&TSS-ESS\\\nonumber
&=&(M_{1}y)^{T}M_{1}y\\\nonumber
&-&[M_{1}X_{2}((M_{1}X_{2})^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}(M_{1}X_{2})^{T}M_{1}y]^{T}M_{1}X_{2}((M_{1}X_{2})^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}(M_{1}X_{2})^{T}M_{1}y\\\nonumber
&=&y^{T}M_{1}y-[M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y]^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y\\\nonumber
&=&y^{T}M_{1}y-y^{T}\bm{M_{1}^{T}}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y\\\nonumber
&=&y^{T}M_{1}y-y^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y\\
\label{eq15}
&=&y^{T}M_{1}y-y^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y
\end{eqnarray}$$



Therefore, 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
RSSR-USSR&=&y^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y
\end{eqnarray}$$



Now the $F$ statistics (\ref{eq14}) can be written as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq16}
F_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{y^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y/r}{y^{T}M_{X}y/(n-k)}
\end{eqnarray}$$



Under the null hypothesis $y=X_{1}\beta_{1}+u$


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{M_{X}y}&=&\bm{M_{X}u}\\
M_{1}y&=&M_{1}u\\
\end{eqnarray}$$



Thus, under this hypothesis, the $F$ statistics
(\ref{eq16}) becomes to


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
F_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{u^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}u/r}{u^{T}M_{X}u/(n-k)}\\
\label{eq17}
&=&\frac{\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}\bm{\varepsilon}/r}{\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{X}\bm{\varepsilon}/(n-k)}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $\bm{\varepsilon}=u/\sigma$

The denominator of (\ref{eq17}) is distributed as $\chi^{2}(n-k)$. The quadratic form
of numerator can be written as
$\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}P_{M_{1}X_{2}}\bm{\varepsilon}$, it
is distributed as $\chi^{2}(r)$.

## Chow Test

It is natural to divide a sample into two subsamples, e.g. larger/small
firms, men/women. We want to test whether a linear regression model has
the same coefficients for both the subsamples. Chow test can solve this
problem.

Suppose there are two subsamples, of lengths $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, with
$n=n_{1}+n_{2}$. Both $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are greater than $k$, the
number of regressors. 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\y_{1}\\
\y_{2}
\end{array}\right]
&\mbox{and}&
\x=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\x_{1}\\
\x_{2}
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray}$$

 Even we need different parameter vectors $\be_{1}$ and
$\be_{2}$ for two subsamples, we can nonetheless put the subsamples
together into a regression model 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq25}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\y_{1}\\
\y_{2}
\end{array}\right]=
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\x_{1}\\
\x_{2}
\end{array}\right]\be_{1}+
\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
\x_{2}
\end{array}\right]\gamma+u
&,&u\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}I)
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $\be_{1}+\gamma=\be_{2}$.

We could rewrite (\ref{eq25}) 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq26}
\y=\x\be_{1}+Z\gamma+u&,&u\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}I)
\end{eqnarray}$$

 The null hypothesis is $H_{0}:\gamma=0$ and it
has been expressed as a set of $k$ zero restrictions. We can use classic
$F$ test. However, if $SSR_{1}$ and $SSR_{2}$ denote the sums of squared
residuals from two regressions, and $RSSR$ denotes the sum of squared
residuals from regressing $\y$ on $\x$, the $F$ statistic becomes


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq27}
F_{\gamma}&=&\frac{(RSSR-SSR_{1}-SSR_{2})/k}{(SSR_{1}+SSR_{2})/(n-2k)}
\end{eqnarray}$$



# Large-Sample Tests in Linear Regression Models

Asymptotic theory is concerned with the distributions of estimators and
test statistics as the sample size $n$ tends to infinity.

## Laws of Large Number

A law of large numbers may apply to any quantity which can be written as
an average of $n$ random variable, that is, $1/n$ times their sum.


$$\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{x}&\equiv&\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $x_{t}$ are **independent** random variables, each
with **bounded finite variance** $\sigma_{t}^{2}$ and **with a common
mean** $\mu$. As $n\to \infty$, $\bar{x}\to\mu$.

There are many different LLNs, some of which do not require that the
individual random variables have a common mean or be independent,
although the amount of dependence must be limited.

If we can apply a LLN to any random average, we can treat it as a
nonrandom quantity for the purpose of asymptotic analysis.

## Central Limit Theorems

In many circumstance, $1/\sqrt{n}$ times the sum of $n$ centered random
variables will approximately follow a normal distribution.

Suppose that the random variables $x_{t}$, $t=1,\dots,n$ are
independently and identically distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance
$\sigma^{2}$. Then according to the Lindebery-LÃ©vy central limit theorem


$$\begin{eqnarray}
z&\equiv&\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{x_{t}-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 is **asymptotically distributed** as $N(0,1)$. This
means that as $n\to\infty$, the random variable $z$ tends to a random
variable which follows the $N(0,1)$.

For a sequence of random variables, $x_{t}$, $t=1,\dots,n$ with
$E(x_{t})=0$ 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\plim_{n\to\infty}n^{-1/2}\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_{t}=x_{0}\sim N\left(0,\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}Var(x_{t})\right)
\end{eqnarray}$$



It can also be applied to the multivariate version of CLTs.

## Asymptotic Tests

Suppose that the DGP is 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq18}
y&=&\bm{X\beta}_{0}+u\\
\nonumber
u&\sim&IID(0, \sigma^{2}_{0}I)
\end{eqnarray}$$

 We make another assumptions 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq19}
E(u_{t}|X_{t})&=&0\\
\nonumber
E(u_{t}^{2}|X_{t})&=&\sigma^{2}_{0}
\end{eqnarray}$$

From the point of view of the error terms, it says that
they are **innovations**. From the point of view of the explanatory
variables $X_{t}$, they are **predetermined** with respect to the
errors terms.

To be able to use asymptotic results, we assume that the DGP for the
explanatory variables is such that 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq20}
\plim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}X^{T}X&=&S_{X^{T}X}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $S_{X^{T}X}$ is a finite,
deterministic, positive definite matrix.

We rewrite $t_{\beta_{2}}$ as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq21}
t_{\beta_{2}}&=&\left(\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{n-k}\right)^{-1/2}\frac{n^{-1/2}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y}{\left(n^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}
\end{eqnarray}$$



As $n\to\infty$, $s^{2}\equiv\frac{y^{T}\bm{M_{X}y}}{n-k}$
tends to $\sigma_{0}^{2}$. So the first factor in
(\ref{eq21}) tends to
$1/\sigma_{0}$ as $n\to\infty$.

When DGP with $\beta_{2}=0$, we have that
$M_{1}y=M_{1}u$, and so
(\ref{eq21}) is
asymptotically equivalent to 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq22}
t_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{n^{-1/2}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}u}{\sigma_{0}\left(n^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}\right)^{1/2}}
\end{eqnarray}$$



If we reinstate the assumption that the regressors are exogenous, the
conditional variance of the numerator of
(\ref{eq22}) is


$$\begin{eqnarray}
E(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}uu^{T}M_{1}X_{2}|X)&=&\sigma_{0}^{2}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}
\end{eqnarray}$$



Thus (\ref{eq22}) has mean
$0$ and variance $1$, conditional on $X$. They are also the
unconditional mean and variance.

Under the null hypothesis, with exogenous regressors, 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq23}
t_{\beta_{2}}&\sim&N(0,1)
\end{eqnarray}$$



## The $t$ Test with Predetermined Regressors

To the $k-$vector 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{v}&\equiv&n^{-1/2}X^{T}u=n^{-1/2}\sum_{t=1}^{n}u_{t}X^{T}
\end{eqnarray}$$



We assume $E(u_{t}|X_{t})=0$. This implies that
$E(u_{t}X_{t}^{T})=0$, as required for the CLT, which then tells us
that 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{v}&\sim&N\left(0, \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}Var(u_{t}X_{t}^{T})\right)=N\left(0, \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}E(u_{t}^{2}X_{t}^{T}X_{t})\right)
\end{eqnarray}$$





$$\begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}E(u_{t}^{2}X_{t}^{T}X_{t})&=&\lim_{n\to\infty}\sigma_{0}^{2}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}E(X_{t}^{T}X_{t})\\
&=&\sigma_{0}^{2}\plim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}X_{t}^{T}X_{t}\\
&=&\sigma_{0}^{2}\plim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}X^{T}X\\
&=&\sigma_{0}^{2}S_{X^{T}X}
\end{eqnarray}$$



## Asymptotic $F$ Tests

$F$ statistics ([\[eq16\]](#eq16){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq16"}) under the null hypothesis that $\beta_{2}=0$ can
be rewritten as 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
F_{\beta_{2}}&=&\frac{y^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}y/r}{y^{T}M_{X}y/(n-k)}\\
\nonumber
&=&\frac{\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}\bm{\varepsilon}/r}{\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{X}\bm{\varepsilon}/(n-k)}\\
\label{eq24}
&=&\frac{n^{-1/2}\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{1}X_{2}(n^{-1}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}X_{2})^{-1}n^{-1/2}X_{2}^{T}M_{1}\bm{\varepsilon}/r}{\bm{\varepsilon}^{T}M_{X}\bm{\varepsilon}/(n-k)}
\end{eqnarray}$$

 where $\bm{\varepsilon}=u/\sigma_{0}$.
