# Data Generation Processes

Let $$x_{t}$$ be an $$m\times 1$$ vector of economic variables generated at
time $$t$$. Such variables are typically inter0related both
contemporaneously and across time. The collection
$$\{x_{t},-\infty< t < \infty\}$$ is called a vector-valued random sequence.

The data generation process (DGP) is represented by the conditional
density 

\begin{equation}
D_{t}\left(x_{t}\mid\mathcal{X}_{t-1}\right)
\end{equation}
where
$$\mathcal{X}_{t-1}=\sigma\left(x_{t-1},x_{t-2},x_{t-3},\cdots\right)$$.
This is a shorthand for the $$\sigma$$-field representing knowledge of the
past history of the system. Notice that

::: remark
$$D_{t}$$ is allowed to depend on time, because the data are not assumed
to be stationary.

# DGPs and Models

A dynamic econometric model is a family of functions of the data which
are intended to mimic aspects of the DGP, either $$D_{t}$$ itself or
functions derived from $$D_{t}$$ such as moments. Formally, a model is a
family of functions 

\begin{equation}
\{M\left(x_{t},x_{t-1},x_{t-2},\cdots,d_{t};\psi\right),\psi\in\Psi\},\Psi\subset\mathbb{R}^{p}
\end{equation}

In particular, let $$M_{D}$$ be a model of complete DGP.

-   Parameters $$\psi$$: $$p$$ in number; parameters are constants that
    are common to every $$t$$.
-   Parameter space: $$\Psi$$ denotes the set of admissible parameter
    values.
-   The vector $$d_{t}$$ represents variables, treated as
    non-stochastic, which are intended to capture the changes in the DGP
    over time.

The relationship between the DGP and the model is a difficult issue. The
axiom of correct specification is the assumption that there exists a
model element that is identical to the corresponding function of the
DGP. $$M_{D}$$ is correctly specified if there exists
$$\psi_{0}\in\Psi$$ such that 
\begin{equation}
M_{D}\left(x_{t},x_{t-1},x_{t-2},\cdots,d_{t};\psi_{0}\right) = D_{t}\left(x_{t}\mid\mathcal{X}_{t-1}\right)
\end{equation}
In general, correct specification in practical modelling
exercises is an implausible assumption.

# Sequence Properties

## Stationarity

A random sequence $$\{x_{t}\}$$ is said to be *stationary in the wide
sense/covariance-stationary* if the mean, the variance and the sequence
of $$j$$th-order autocovariances for $$j>0$$ are all independent of $$t$$. It
is said to be *stationary in the strict sense* if for every $$k>0$$, the
joint distributions of all collections
$$\left(x_{t},x_{t+1},x_{t+2},\cdots,x_{t+k}\right)$$ do not depend in
any way on $$t$$.

## Mixing

In a mixing sequence the realization of the sequence at time $$t$$
contains no information about the realization at either $$t-j$$ or $$t+j$$,
when $$j$$ is sufficiently large. The mixing property ensures that points
in the sequence appear randomly sampled when they are far enough apart.

::: remark
Stationarity and mixing are quite distinct properties.
:::

## Ergodicity

A stationary sequence having the property that a random event involving
every member of the sequence always has probability either 0 or 1 is
called *ergodic*.

::: theorem
If $$\{x_{t}\}$$ is a stationary ergodic sequence, and $$E(x_1)$$ exists,
$$\bar{x}_{n}\to E(x_{1})$$ with probability 1.
