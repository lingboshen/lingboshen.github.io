1.  A **data-generating process**, or **DGP** is simply the mechanism
    that actually generated the data. A key feature of a DGP is that it
    constitutes a **complete specification**. Enough information is
    provided for the DGP to be simulated on a computer. A **model** is
    defined as a set of data-generating processes.

    A model is **misspecified** if the DGP does not belong to the model
    under study.

2.  Simple linear regression model:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dmch1-regmodel}
	   	y_{t}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{t}+u_{t}
	\end{equation}
    -   $$t$$: index the **observations** of a **sample**

    -   $$n$$: total number of observations, i.e., **sample size**

    -   $$y_{t}$$: **dependent variable** for observation $$t$$

    -   $$X_{t}$$: an observation on a single **expalnatory variable**, or
        **independent variable**

    -   $$\beta_{1},\beta_{2}$$: two unknown **parameters**

    -   $$\beta_{1}$$: **constant** or **intercept**

    -   $$\beta_{2}$$: **slope coefficient**

    -   $$u_{t}$$: the unknown **error term**

    -   $$\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{t}$$: **regression function**

    -   $$\Omega_{t}$$: **information set** includes variables that
        potential explantatry variables. Specifying a regression model
        is deciding which of the variables that belong to $$\Omega_{t}$$
        should be included in the model.

    1.  Try to explain the observed values of the dependent variables in
        terms of those of the explanatory variable.

    2.  $$u_{t}$$ is assumed to be a **random variable**. Its expectation
        value is zero whatever the value of $$X_{t}$$ to **identify** the
        unknown parameters. Actually we are assuming that on average the
        effects of the neglected determinants tend to cancel out.

    3.  We never say that the effect of $$u_t$$ is necessarily small. Even
        if the proportion is large, this model is still useful if it
        allows us to see how $$y_t$$ is related to the observed variables
        $$X_t$$.

    4.  **How to estimate and test hypothesis about the parameters?**

    5.  A strong assumption about $$u_t$$ is IID. The $$u_{t}$$ will suffer
        **serial correlation** or **heteroskedasticity**.

3.  Matrix form of a simple linear regression model 
\begin{equation}  
\label{eqm1}
\begin{split}
    y_{1}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{1}+u_{1}\\ 
    y_{2}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+u_{2}\\
    &\vdots\\ 
    y_{n}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{n}+u_{n}
    \end{split}
	\end{equation}   

\begin{equation}  
\begin{split}
    y_{1}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{1}+u_{1}\\ 
    y_{2}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+u_{2}\\
    &\vdots\\ 
    y_{n}&=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{n}+u_{n}
    \end{split}
	\end{equation} 

    Let $$y$$ denote an $$n$$-vector, $$u$$ an $$n$$-vector, $$X$$ an $$n\times 2$$
    matrix, and $$\beta$$ a $$2$$-vector. 
    \begin{aligned}
    y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    y_{1}\\
    y_{2}\\
    \vdots\\
    y_{n}
    \end{array}\right],
    u=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    u_{1}\\
    u_{2}\\
    \vdots\\
    u_{n}
    \end{array}\right],
    X=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    1&X_{1}\\
    1&X_{2}\\
    \vdots&\vdots\\
    1&X_{n}
    \end{array}\right]&\mbox{,and}&
    \beta=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    \beta_{1}\\
    \beta_{2}\\
    \end{array}\right]
    \end{aligned}
    Equations (\eqref{eq:dmch1-regmodel}) can be rewritten as 

    \begin{aligned}
    \label{eqm2}
    y&=&X\beta+u
    \end{aligned}

    - **regressors**: separate columns of the matrix $$X$$

    - **regressand**: column vector $$y$$

4.  Multivariable linear regression model We have $$k$$ regressors and
    $$\beta$$ now is $$k$$-vector 
    \begin{aligned}
    y=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    y_{1}\\
    y_{2}\\
    \vdots\\
    y_{n}
    \end{array}\right],
    u=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    u_{1}\\
    u_{2}\\
    \vdots\\
    u_{n}
    \end{array}\right],
    X=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
    X_{11}&X_{12}&\cdots&X_{1k}\\
    X_{21}&X_{22}&\cdots&X_{2k}\\
    \vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\\
    X_{n1}&X_{n2}&\cdots&X_{nk}
    \end{array}\right]&\mbox{,and}&
    \beta=\left[\begin{array}{c}
    \beta_{1}\\
    \beta_{2}\\
    \vdots\\
    \beta_{k}
    \end{array}\right]
    \end{aligned}$$ The model is $$\begin{aligned}
    y&=&X\beta+u
    \end{aligned}

    A typical row of this equation is 
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{eqm3}
    y_{t}&=&X_{t}\beta+u_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_{i}X_{ti}+u_{t}
    \end{aligned}
    where $$X_{t}$$ is the $$t^{th}$$ row of $$X$$.
