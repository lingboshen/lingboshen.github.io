The post discusses Petersen (2009) on estimating standard errors in finance panel data set.

# Introduction

Two forms of dependence for a firmâ€™s residuals

- **time-series dependence (unobserved firm effect)**: correlated across years
- **cross-sectional dependence (time effect)**: correlated across different firms

# Estimating Standard Errors in the Presence of a Fixed Firm Effect

The standard regression for a panel data set

$$
Y_{it} = X_{it}\beta+\varepsilon_{it}
$$

where $i$ represents firms and $t$ represents years.

We assume that $X$ and $\varepsilon$ to be independent of each other and to have a zero mean and finite variance. The OLS estimated coefficient is

$$
\hat{\beta}_{OLS}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{t=1}^{T}X_{it}Y_{it}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{t=1}^{T}X_{it}^{2}}
$$
